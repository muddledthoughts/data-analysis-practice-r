#Create an integer vector named math_grades that contains the Exams, Homework, and Projects grades for the math class in that order.

#Create a double vector named exam_grades that contains the Exams grades for all classes in their order as contained in the dataset.

#Create a logical vector named is_stem_classes that contains for each class TRUE if this class is a "STEM" class and FALSE if it is "non-STEM" class.

#Class	Exams	Homework	Projects	
#Math	92	87	85	STEM
#Chemistry	90	81	92	STEM
#Writing	84	95	79	non-STEM
#Art	95	86	93	non-STEM
#History	77	85	90	non-STEM
#Music	92	90	91	non-STEM
#Physical Education	85	88	95	non-STEM
